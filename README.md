### 👋  - Hi! My name is Adwait Ganguly, and I am a junior studying Computer Science at Northwestern University.

👨‍💻  - My career interests are focused on Software/ML Engineering + Robotics, but in the long run, I look forward to building my own company. 

💻  - I am an avid programmer, and building software from start to finish is one of the few things that can grasp my attention for hours on end. 

📸  - In my free time, you can find me reading, playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, or taking photos!
